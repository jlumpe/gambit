GAMBIT (Genomic Approximation Method for Bacterial Identification and Tracking) is a tool for rapid taxonomic identification of microbial pathogens.
It uses an efficient genomic distance metric along with a curated database of approximately 50,000 reference genomes (derived from NCBI
[RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/)) to identify genome assemblies from across the Bacterial kingdom in seconds.

See below for basic installation and usage instructions, or check out the
[documentation](https://gambit-genomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest) for more detailed information and
a basic tutorial.

## Installation

Install the Python library from Bioconda:

```
conda install -c bioconda gambit
```

Then download the reference database files and place them in a directory of your choice:

* [gambit-refseq-curated-1.0.gdb](https://storage.googleapis.com/jlumpe-gambit/public/databases/refseq-curated/1.0/gambit-refseq-curated-1.0.gdb)
* [gambit-refseq-curated-1.0.gs](https://storage.googleapis.com/jlumpe-gambit/public/databases/refseq-curated/1.0/gambit-refseq-curated-1.0.gs)


## Basic usage

    gambit [-d /path/to/database/] query [-o results.csv] genome1.fasta genome2.fasta ...

Positional arguments are one or more FASTA files containing query genome assemblies. You must
provide the path to the directory containing the database files using either the `-d` option
(*before* the `query` subcommand) or by setting the `GAMBIT_DB_PATH` environment variable.

See the documentation for additional details on the command line interface and description of the output.
